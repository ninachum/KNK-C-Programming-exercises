C  is  quirky,  flaweddddddsssssssss*  and  an  ensdsdormous
success. Although accidents of  history  surely  helped,  it
evidently satisfied  a  need  for  a  system  implementation
language effifient enough to displace assembly language, yet
sufficiently abstract and fluent to describe algorithms  and
interactions in a wide variety of environments. -- Dennis M.
