(a)
if storage is damaged, at least some of the files can be recovered.
many people can be involved in development at a time.

(b)
complex source file management
requires careful function, variable... management

2.

(b)
if a changes occurs to a header file that contains function definitions,
all the object files that affected by the change must be recompiled.


3.

compiler will serach current directory first.
if there is a header file with same same in that directory, the system header file that was intended won't be loaded.

(a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i: 1
Value of j: 2
Value of k: 3
Value of (i + j): 3
Value of 2 * i + j - k: 1

(b)
Output if DEBUG is not defined:

(c)
whether DEBUG is defined, or not.

(d)
yes, because preprocessor is procedural.
